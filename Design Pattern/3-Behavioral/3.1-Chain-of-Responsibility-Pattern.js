// The Chain of Responsibility passes requests along a chain of handlers.
//  Each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to
// the next handler in the chain.

// For this pattern we could use the same exact example as before,
//  as middlewares in Express are somehow handlers that either process
//  a request or pass it to the next handler.

// If you'd like another example, think about any
//  system in which you have certain information to process along many steps.
// At each step a different entity is in charge of performing an action,
//  and the information only gets passed to another entity if a certain condition is met.

// A typical front-end app that consumes an API could work as an example:

// We have a function responsible for rendering a UI component.

// Once rendered, a another function makes a request to an API endpoint.

// If the endpoint response is as expected, the information is passed to another
// function that sorts the data in a given way and stores it in a variable.

// Once that variable stores the needed information,
//  another function is responsible of rendering it in the UI.
